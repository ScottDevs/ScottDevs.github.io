<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>My name is Justin Hardcastle I am currently going to Ivy Tech Community Collage and taking Visual Communication classes. My end goal is to be able to go into a job that involves coding wether it be coding websites or mobile applications. 
This website is supposed to act as a timeline, starting Monday November 30th, 2015. I will each week save a copy of the current website setup. My end goal is to be able to look back and see how I have grown over the years as well as show others.</p>
